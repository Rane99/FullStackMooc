My choice for the language is python. My choice for linting would be Flake8 since it is widely used and wraps together Pyflake and pep8 which are used for error detection and style guiding. For testing I would use python unittest unit testing framework. It is also very popular since it is part of the python standard library and it seems to be easy to use. 

One good choice for CI could be GitLab CI/CD. It seems to be also very popular and a good alternative for Github Actions. Another interesting choice would be JetBrains TeamCity. I personally have good experience of JetBrains products and most likely this would also fit for this project. One major downside is that its enterprise version is quite expensive but for commercial use it might not be that bad. 

Deciding whether to use a self-hosted or cloud-based environment depends for instance if our team has anyone who has experience for setting up a self-hosted environment. Also project budget can affect our decision. If building in the cloud becomes too expensive it might be better to buy your own servers. Our project only consists of 6 people so the project probably won't be that big which suggests the use of a cloud environment.
